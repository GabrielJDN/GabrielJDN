This portfolio is structured in the following way: I have projects written both in portuguese and english. As for my study notes, they are all written in portuguese.

<h3>Data Analysis Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>São Paulo Housing Price:</b> In this project, I cleaned the data, found the outliers and created an ML algorithm where giving some parameters we could find how much we should sell a house in its neighborhood. Here is the project in  <a href=https://github.com/GabrielJDN/Projetos-Projects/blob/main/English/São%20Paulo%20housing%20prices/Final%20Project.ipynb>english</a> and here in <a href=https://github.com/GabrielJDN/Projetos-Projects/blob/main/Português/Previsão%20de%20preço%20de%20imóveis%20em%20São%20Paulo/Projeto_Final_Portugues.ipynb>portuguese</a>.</li>
  <li><b>OLIST Data Analysis:</b> Olist is an Brazillian online marketplace. In this project, I try to answer some questions related that people from the bussiness area are interested in (for example creating some KPI's, the best selling products each month, who are our best sellers). For now, this project is still in progress.</li>
  <li><b>The News Bussines Case:</b> This Data Analysis was done for the Bussines Case when I applied for a Data Analyst job in <a href=https://thenewscc.com.br>The News</a>, an Brazillian journalism company. In this project, I explored the data finding the null values and solving the problem that occured during the extraction when the Entry Date(the day when the client started using the services) and the Last Opened(the last day the client used the service) where being randomly swapped. With this done, I started looking for the best channel for client aquisition and found behavior patterns in the clients. For now, this project is only written in portuguese and can be fin <a href=https://github.com/GabrielJDN/Projetos-Projects/blob/main/Português/Estudo%20de%20caso%20The%20News/The_News_Analise_Dados.ipynb>here</a>.</li>
